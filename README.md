# Color_Image_Segmentation
Color image segmentatiom using several state-of-art clustering algorithms, including Fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM), Fuzzy subspace clustering (FSC), Maximum entropy clustering (MEC) and Gaussian mixture model (GMM).  
****  
FCM, FSC and MEC have introducted in [Fuzzy_Clustering_Algorithms](https://github.com/kailugaji/Fuzzy_Clustering_Algorithms).  
GMM has intruducted in [Gaussian_Mixture_Model_for_Clustering](https://github.com/kailugaji/Gaussian_Mixture_Model_for_Clustering).
